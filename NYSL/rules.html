            <h2 class="content-title"> Rules & Policies</h2>
            <h4 class="content-title"> FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</h4>
            <h2>SPORTMANSHIP</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire youth to practice the
                    ideals
                    of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
                    referee
                    whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                    technical
                    soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> FIFA Law1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
                    given maximum and
                    minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
                    under
                    12 and older.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must be a
                    minimum of
                    100 x 60 yards.
                    Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are
                    unable to
                    provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board
                    which
                    will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not
                    a
                    waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                    associations
                    that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>
                    <ol class="letra">
                        <li>
                            U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older
                            age
                            groups should be progressively larger.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions and size
                            of goal similarly modified.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>ALL-PLAY</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at least fifty percent of
                    each
                    game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under special
                            circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice and/or games, ungentlemanly
                            conduct at
                            practice and/or games, and injuries.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
